git commit -m "Refactor Post Context: Split into PostActionsContext and PostDataContext\
\
- Created PostActionsContext to handle post-related actions (fetching, creating, updating, deleting posts and comments).\
- Created PostDataContext to manage post data state (posts, trending posts, loading states).\
- Updated PostProvider to use both contexts for better separation of concerns.\
- Refactored components to utilize the new context structure, ensuring backward compatibility with usePost hook.\
- Enhanced CommentSection and CommentItem components to handle comment actions through the new context.\
- Improved ProfileLayout to manage user posts more efficiently."
